# linear-optim-tute
Builds hospital-based tutorial on linear programming in Python to be displayed on Orbisant Analytics website. The Orbisant Analytics post can be accessed at: https://www.orbisantanalytics.com/mathematical-optimisation

## Scenario explanation

### Situation
The client, a major hospital in your city ('the hospital'), has approached you to help them with their operations and efficiency. The hospital notes to you that they are operating in a tough economic climate which is made even more difficult by increasing service demand from patients.

### Complication
The hospital has been operating at a deficit for the past few years. The hospital knows it significantly overspends on staffing costs as it does not know how to determine staffing numbers.

### Question
Can staffing numbers, defined as 'activity units', be optimised to minimise costs while meeting minimum operational requirements to ensure the hospital still receives its activity-based funding from the government?

### Chart output
